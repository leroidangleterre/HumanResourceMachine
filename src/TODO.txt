TODO:

Make sure the window and the two components are painted at launch.

When Terrain receives a event from the mouse (as a controller), it fires an
event that is received by the model.

When TerrainModel is changed, it fires an event that is received by the
component, which repaints itself (as a view).

Keyboard events: Detect them and connect them to the appropriate actions.


DONE:


Mouse events:
When a click happens on one panel, every mouse movement or mouse release should be redirected to that same panel,
even when the mouse hovers the other panel.


Terrain.setSquare: solve the special case of line/column index over/underflow;


Create actual Swing components for the Terrain and the Script, so that Terrain
is the Swing component (visible and drawn) and TerrainModel is the data.

When a group of selected instructions are moved, every time the last non-selected instruction
has its center overlapped by the moving block, it will be re-ranked to just after the moving block.
