TODO:

Change the event handling chain: a mouse event detected by the Script shall be transmitted to an instruction through its
"mousePressed(MouseEvent)" method. The method "receiveCommand" probably should be removed.

Keyboard events: Detect them and connect them to the appropriate actions.

Prevent the three instructions in an "If Else Endif" construct to swap. Their order must be maintained.

Delete the targets of Jump and If instructions when the Jump or the If is deleted.

Moving an instruction containing sub-instructions, such as If, shall translate all the instructions between If and the corresponding End.

When a composite instruction is created (Jump or If), the targets shall appear immediately at the bottom of the main instruction, not at the address zero.

DONE:

Paint the Direction inside the MoveInstruction.
The Direction is painted with four possible small arrows, each pointing in a given heading (N, S, E or W);
A right-click on a MoveInstruction shall toggle the direction.

Make sure the window and the two components are painted at launch.

Mouse events:
When a click happens on one panel, every mouse movement or mouse release should be redirected to that same panel,
even when the mouse hovers the other panel.


Terrain.setSquare: solve the special case of line/column index over/underflow;


Create actual Swing components for the Terrain and the Script, so that Terrain
is the Swing component (visible and drawn) and TerrainModel is the data.

When a group of selected instructions are moved, every time the last non-selected instruction
has its center overlapped by the moving block, it will be re-ranked to just after the moving block.

Change the way the instructions are sorted and displayed

Each worker has a script address that is incremented by a subclass of InstructionModel, which tells the worker what to do.
A "move" of "pickup" instruction will send the worker to the next instruction, but a "Jump" (equivalent of "goto") will sent them to a specific address.

Implemented Pickup and Drop instructions.

Fixed instruction deletion in Script and ScriptModel.

Painted an arrow between a Jump instruction and its target (the instruction it jumps to).

Added "center" direction to the compass. Available to pickup the block in the current square, or for the move instruction.

If instruction: display with an indentation everything inside the "if" part and the "else" part.
The x-position of the instructions shall be computed in "Script.computeSizesAndPositions()".
