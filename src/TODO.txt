TODO:

Keyboard events: Detect them and connect them to the appropriate actions.


DONE:

Paint the Direction inside the MoveInstruction.
The Direction is painted with four possible small arrows, each pointing in a given heading (N, S, E or W);
A right-click on a MoveInstruction shall toggle the direction.

Make sure the window and the two components are painted at launch.

Mouse events:
When a click happens on one panel, every mouse movement or mouse release should be redirected to that same panel,
even when the mouse hovers the other panel.


Terrain.setSquare: solve the special case of line/column index over/underflow;


Create actual Swing components for the Terrain and the Script, so that Terrain
is the Swing component (visible and drawn) and TerrainModel is the data.

When a group of selected instructions are moved, every time the last non-selected instruction
has its center overlapped by the moving block, it will be re-ranked to just after the moving block.

Change the way the instructions are sorted and displayed

Each worker has a script address that is incremented by a subclass of InstructionModel, which tells the worker what to do.
A "move" of "pickup" instruction will sent the worker to the next instruction, but a "goto" will sent them to a specific address.

Implemented Pickup and Drop instructions.

Fixed instruction deletion in Script and ScriptModel.

Painted an arrow between a Jump instruction and its target (the instruction it jumps to).
